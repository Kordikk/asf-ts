# ASF-TS portable workflow delivery

Delivery date: 4 October 2026. Upstream baseline: `bd82062e27407e6cec6799ef22d632a123186d33`. Port reference: [Python PR #21](https://github.com/asmelkowski/asf/pull/21), head `5f6cd638cd7134b2e959861eb2ae2849fd30a181`.

The [TS analysis and design](../designs/ts-port.md) maps Python features to the existing TS runtime. The port retains ordinary async TypeScript, native Codex/OpenCode sessions, immutable accounting, supervised self-improvement and the original inspector. Portable files add an optional authoring layer over the same reservation and receipt boundary.

## Ticket acceptance

The table maps upstream tickets to implementation, design and plan evidence. All feature tickets remain open until upstream accepts the final integration PR. [Roadmap #1](https://github.com/asmelkowski/asf-ts/issues/1) tracks the delivery and deferred frameworks.

[Foundation PR 1](https://github.com/Kordikk/asf-ts/pull/1) records the design, dependency/platform choices and offline CI. [PR 10](https://github.com/Kordikk/asf-ts/pull/10) removes host scheduling from two persisted-deadline regression fixtures; it changes no production deadline behavior. All smaller PRs target `Kordikk/asf-ts:integration/portable-workflows` because the current account has read access to upstream. See [ADR 0003](../adr/0003-delivery-topology.md).

The shared [runtime/roles](../plans/runtime-and-roles.md), [candidate/ADK](../plans/candidate-and-adk.md) and [editor/inspection](../plans/editor-and-inspection.md) plans combine the port design with specialist designs. The design-to-plan relationship is many-to-many. New technical documents use the [Google developer documentation style decision](../adr/0001-document-style.md).

## Validation evidence

Final production source under review: `1f7dbb2d30cd0d9ee6962cfe875c15a146338bbc`. Independent Standards and Spec reviews cleared the final renderer delta. Actual Chromium rendering confirmed visible, distinct branch labels when both ports share a target. Seven renderer/file tests passed at that exact revision.

The complete local `npm run check` at predecessor `ec8575ade842b7b68365f783b27aeaa380e5fb31` passed type checks, lint, formatting, build and **242 tests**, with **zero failures and two opt-in lifecycle skips**. The final Linux [push CI](https://github.com/Kordikk/asf-ts/actions/runs/37195648389/job/111416830518) and [PR CI](https://github.com/Kordikk/asf-ts/actions/runs/37195650248/job/111416836079) passed the same complete gate at `1f7dbb2d30cd0d9ee6962cfe875c15a146338bbc`, including the later branch visibility fix. Both checks were successful before merge.

The skips are installed-native-CLI probes controlled by `ASF_TEST_CODEX` and `ASF_TEST_OPENCODE`. Normal CI does not opt into them. Codex/OpenCode portable conformance uses injected official SDK seams; ADK conformance uses the actual pinned SDK with deterministic local models and tools. No paid provider qualification, invoice completeness or restored unfinished native checkpoint is claimed. Dependency audit on 4 October 2026 reported zero vulnerabilities.

| Browser check      | Observed result                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original inspector | Built/source/served parity; scope/session/turn selection, live polling, bounded paging, literal content, mobile/keyboard and unresolved costs passed                        |
| Studio             | All eight block forms, typed children, profiles, layouts, invalid drafts, stale response rejection and actual JSON/YAML download/reimport passed                            |
| Declared graph     | Exact ancestry and receipt IDs, corrections, completed business rejection, unchanged replay counts, uncertain-send subtotal, independent windows and focused queries passed |

These three actual Playwright checks ran against built assets at source `27b64cebdf662c811510ead6c72d3151b3c68721` on 4 October 2026, using Chromium `141.0.7390.37`. The graph report timestamp is `2026-10-04T10:07:56.746Z`. The source/build/served UI assets have no later content changes. Fixtures used synthetic or ephemeral SQLite stores, scripted native receipts and local callbacks. Browser checks made no external provider requests, read no private native sessions and dispatched no work through inspection. Studio validation did not write run/event rows.

Reproduce from the repository root:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
npm audit
# Install the pinned browser once if it is not cached:
npx playwright install chromium
npm run verify:ui -- --quick
npx tsx scripts/verify-studio.ts
npx tsx scripts/verify-graph.ts
```

Local browser artifacts are ignored under `.asf/ui-verification/`, `.asf/studio-verification/` and `.asf/graph-verification/`. Historical live-provider evidence retained from the TS baseline is separate and does not qualify this delivery's SDK pins.

Use the [portable guide](../portable.md) for the file pipeline and local UI. This delivery adds no hosted editor, provider credential manager, process sandbox, automatic publication or hard invoice cap. Unknown accounting remains unresolved, and uncertain effects are not automatically repeated.
